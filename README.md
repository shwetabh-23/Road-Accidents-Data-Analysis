# Road-Accidents-Data-Analysis


This data analysis project focuses on exploring road accidents data to gain insights into the different kinds of vehicles causing accidents and the time of day when accidents occur. By analyzing this data, we aim to understand the factors contributing to road accidents and potentially uncover patterns that can help improve road safety measures.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains comprehensive information about road accidents, including details about the vehicles involved and the timing of each accident. It includes attributes such as vehicle types, accident dates, times, locations, and other relevant factors.

# Objectives
The main objectives of this data analysis project are:

Identify the types of vehicles most frequently involved in road accidents.
Determine the distribution of accidents occurring during the day versus at night.
Explore any correlations between vehicle types and the time of day accidents happen.
Analyze additional factors such as weather conditions or road types that may influence accident occurrences.

# Methodology
To achieve these objectives, the following steps will be undertaken:

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Perform necessary data cleaning tasks, handle missing values, and ensure the dataset is ready for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis: Conduct exploratory analysis to gain initial insights into the distribution of vehicle types involved in accidents and the occurrence of accidents during different times of the day.

Visualizations: Create visual representations, such as bar charts, pie charts, or heatmaps, to effectively communicate the findings and patterns discovered in the data.

Statistical Analysis: Utilize statistical techniques to determine the significance of relationships between vehicle types and accident occurrence times.

Reporting and Conclusion: Summarize the key findings and conclusions derived from the analysis, including recommendations for potential road safety measures based on the insights gained.
